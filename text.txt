Remember to use of your libft the best way you can! Using get_next_line(),
ft_split() and other functions will allow you to read data from the file in a quick and
simple way.
Keep in mind that the goal of this project is not to parse maps! However, this doesn’t
mean that your program should crash when run. It means that we assume the map
contained in the file is properly formatted.
V.2 Graphic management
• Your program has to display the image in a window.
• The management of your window must remain smooth (changing to another win-
dow, minimizing, and so forth).
• Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
• Clicking on the cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit the
program in a clean way.
• The use of the images of the MiniLibX is mandatory.
